from Anuj Sharma to All Participants:
docker ps | grep bootcamp
from Srikarnelly to All Participants:
do we need to run these commands now?
from Arindam.mallik to All Participants:
So, we are not going to run 
from Arindam.mallik to All Participants:

kubectl run kubernetes-nginx --image=nginx --port=80
from Arindam.mallik to All Participants:
ok
from Reshma Umapathy to All Participants:
So... we can have many docker images inside a pod, right?
from vishnu to All Participants:
can u paste the commands again ..just joined 
from sweta.gupta@dieboldnixdorf.com  to All Participants:
blank screen is displayed
from Bhagavankrishna.b to All Participants:
what is the command on line 25?
from Srikarnelly to All Participants:
are there any system specifications for handling Pods?

from Harshu_l to All Participants:
Can you explain the concept of taint nodes if u have time
from Somyashree Padhi to All Participants:
anuj can you explain again what is namesapces
from Bhagavankrishna.b to All Participants:
in prod environment, we will never have master and worker in the same right?
from Somyashree Padhi to All Participants:
does this equivalent to stages ?
from Somyashree Padhi to All Participants:
got it
from Bhagavankrishna.b to All Participants:
so, if I want to group my pods, I can use namespace?
from Bkarim60 to All Participants:
Anuj , got the following error
from Bkarim60 to All Participants:
0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) had taints that the pod didn't tolerate.
from Bkarim60 to All Participants:
pods are still not ready

ip add is same
from Arindam.mallik to All Participants:
yes
from Maramreddy.k to All Participants:
since its lab i guess
from Somyashree Padhi to All Participants:
even for nagios it was same
from Maramreddy.k to All Participants:
yes
from Srk.guess to All Participants:
yes
from Harshu_l to All Participants:
I am getting  error "curl: (7) Failed to connect to 10.0.1.4 port 8080: Connection refused

from Harshu_l to All Participants:

from Maramreddy.k to All Participants:
i guess our labs are Azure clone machines hence the same ip.. 
from Swathi Balasubramanian to All Participants:
check the ip

Can u explain the differencce between ip 10.0.1.4 (interface ip) and 10.32.0.4 (ip address assigned to pod) 
from Anuj Sharma to All Participants:
kubectl exec -it kubernetes-bootcamp-76fcb8587-r8bjc bash
from Harshu_l to All Participants:
ok got it thanks 
from Dinesh.unna to All Participants:
after exit command it showing me   you have new mail in /var/mail/root

from Swathi Balasubramanian to All Participants:

from Dinesh.unna to All Participants:
done
from Reshma Umapathy to All Participants:
done
from Goalhits to All Participants:
done
from Bhagavankrishna.b to All Participants:
done
from Dinesh.unna to All Participants:
ok
from Bhagavankrishna.b to All Participants:
can we specify nodeport also?
from Goalhits to All Participants:
you are specifiying target port but still it is being allocated to 30167 port
from Bhagavankrishna.b to All Participants:
targetport is pod port
from vishnu to All Participants:
we can't specify the same 8080 port for two differenr servies right
from Nitesh.vit2011 to All Participants:
how do we access with this port from outside, if it is dynamic
from Goalhits to All Participants:
in that case what is signifacnt for port and target port in expose command
from vishnu to All Participants:
if you dont mind please explain the port concept with in kubernets again 
from vishnu to All Participants:
but we access with 8080 only right
from Nitesh.vit2011 to All Participants:
m not getting this port concept 
from Nitesh.vit2011 to All Participants:
how do we access from outside
from Nitesh.vit2011 to All Participants:
if it is allocated at random basis
from Nitesh.vit2011 to All Participants:
everytime
from Reshma Umapathy to All Participants:
So this random port is used to access the application running on the pod?
from Srikarnelly to All Participants:
your screen is paused?
from Arindam.mallik to All Participants:
can you plz paste this here
from Anuj Sharma to All Participants:
kubectl get svc
kubectl run kubernetes-nginx --image=nginx --port=80
kubectl expose deployment/kubernetes-nginx --port=80 --target-port=80 --type=NodePort
kubectl get svc

from Swathi Balasubramanian to All Participants:
done.
from Reshma Umapathy to All Participants:
I mistakenly gave port as 8080 for nginx
from Reshma Umapathy to All Participants:
What should i do now?
from Reshma Umapathy to All Participants:
kubectl expose
from Shilpipauranik to All Participants:
done
from Harshu_l to All Participants:
The ip 10.99.123.213 is a public ip
from Anuj Sharma to All Participants:
kubectl delete svc kubernetes-nginx
from Reshma Umapathy to All Participants:
Thanks Anuj
from Harshu_l to All Participants:
ok 
from Dinesh.unna to All Participants:
ok
from Maramreddy.k to All Participants:
The Service "kubernetes-nginx" is invalid: spec.type: Unsupported value: "NodePortkubectl": supported values: "ClusterIP", "ExternalName", "LoadBalancer", "NodePort"

from Maramreddy.k to All Participants:
when i execute expose
from Maramreddy.k to All Participants:
sorted Thanks 
from Anuj Sharma to All Participants:
kubectl get pods
kubectl scale deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp --replicas=2
kubectl get pods
kubectl get deployments
curl localhost:30167

from Goalhits to All Participants:
so if different hosts are there in that case port would be different or in that case also port would be same?
from Harshu_l to All Participants:
But kubectl get svc showing different ports
from Goalhits to All Participants:
ok
from Nitesh.vit2011 to All Participants:
at the time of deployment only these port will change based on availabilty   right ??
from Nitesh.vit2011 to All Participants:
ok
from Goalhits to All Participants:
can we expose in multiple host machines using master at one time?
from Harshu_l to All Participants:
Can u paste the curl command u used 
from Goalhits to All Participants:
ok
from Harshu_l to All Participants:
with respect to pods
from Nitesh.vit2011 to All Participants:
curl localhost:30126
from Jacob.mani1704 to All Participants:
docker run kubernetes-nginx --image=nginx --port=80
I get an error"Unable to find image "'kubernetes-nginx:latest' locally
from Jacob.mani1704 to All Participants:
ok got it
from Goalhits to All Participants:
So for each deploymnt we would create new image?
from Anuj Sharma to All Participants:
kubectl set image deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp kubernetes-bootcamp=jocatalin/kubernetes-bootcamp:v2
kubectl get pods
kubectl rollout status deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp
curl localhost:30167
kubectl rollout undo deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp
curl localhost:30167

from Shubham Mathur to All Participants:
Replacing the image from v1 from v2 will cause any loss of data
from Swathi Balasubramanian to All Participants:
so we can rollback only last one or is there a way to rollback a specific one
from Bhagavankrishna.b to All Participants:
is there anything in kubernetes, like auditing like who made changes to the cluster?
from Swathi Balasubramanian to All Participants:
also can we get a deployment log
from Goalhits to All Participants:
so this version we can integrate to jenkins for each deployment?
from Srikarnelly to All Participants:
my v1 pod is not getting terminated
from Nitesh.vit2011 to All Participants:
after enter kubectl get pods   version is not updating to V2 ??
from Nitesh.vit2011 to All Participants:
ok
from Goalhits to All Participants:
in case of any error where we check logs?
from Srikarnelly to All Participants:
how to delete a replica pod
from Goalhits to All Participants:
ok
from Goalhits to All Participants:
how to autoscale based on traffic increase using kubernetes?
from Bhagavankrishna.b to All Participants:
kubectl delete pod pod_name
from Bhagavankrishna.b to All Participants:
it will recreated
from Goalhits to All Participants:
So basically we need to run kubectl scale command however how this command would  be invoked automatically in case of auto scale
from Goalhits to All Participants:
?
from Anuj Sharma to All Participants:
kubectl scale deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp --replicas=0

from Goalhits to All Participants:
ok\
from Goalhits to All Participants:
so can jenkins be integrated with monitoring tools like nagios?
from Goalhits to All Participants:
to achieve auto scaling
from Goalhits to All Participants:
hmmn ok
from Dinesh.unna to All Participants:
please paste that commands
from Srikarnelly to All Participants:
when i am running this command "kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master- "  I am facing this error "error: taint "node-role.kubernetes.io/master:" not found.. can somebody help
from Bhagavankrishna.b to All Participants:
@Srikar, are you able to deploy a pod?
from Bhagavankrishna.b to All Participants:
ok, can you run this command and tell what is the result?
from Bhagavankrishna.b to All Participants:
kubectl get deployments
from Srikarnelly to All Participants:

can project and test would be completed within 10-15 days after revision 
from Kanupriyarchourey to All Participants:
?
from Shubham Mathur to All Participants:
Does changing the image from v1 to v2 will cause any loss of data?
from Dinesh.unna to All Participants:
ok sir
from vishnu to All Participants:
image wont have any data 
from vishnu to All Participants:
image is your war file or jar file ..i mean its all the application code 
from Dinesh.unna to All Participants:
ok sir
from Srikarnelly to All Participants:
difference between kubelet and kubeadm?
from Bhagavankrishna.b to All Participants:
you can use persistent volume
from Goalhits to All Participants:
actually you can have stage wise deployment to avoid data loss
from Reshma Umapathy to All Participants:
Do we have any GUI for K8s?
from Dinesh.unna to All Participants:
thses dlete commands paste we will try home
